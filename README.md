My first programs in Agda, mostly based on [Programming Languages Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/), and a few proofs I wanted to write.

Some comments are a little out of date now, as I have gained a better understanding of the language.

This repository is extremely basic as I only used it to learn the Agda language. I have now moved on to another more advanced project (which is private for now).
